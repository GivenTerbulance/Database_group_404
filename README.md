# Database_group_404---THE PRIMARY KEYS

Database Design & Programming with SQL - BookStore Project ðŸ“š
Collaborators in this project are:

1. Nontando Myoli
2. Given Teboho Ikaneng
3. Loid Aran

In this group project, we teamed up to design and build a MySQL database for a bookstore. From managing books and authors to tracking customers, orders, and shipping, we created a system that keeps everything organized and accessible. We visualized the database structure with Draw.io and followed best practices for user management and security. This project gave us hands-on experience solving real-world database challengesâ€”definitely a rewarding journey!
